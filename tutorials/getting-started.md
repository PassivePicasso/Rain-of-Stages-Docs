Once you've acquired Unity Hub you will need to install a version of Unity 3D compatible with the game you're making content for.    
Rain of Stages was developed initially for Risk of Rain 2 and at the time of this publication was running on   


\(Unity3d 2018.4.16f1\)\[unityhub://2018.4.16f1/e6e9ca02b32a\]  


Using Unity Hub install this version of Unity 3D  




```
$ give me super-powers
```

{% hint style="info" %}
 Super-powers are granted randomly so please submit an issue if you're not happy with yours.
{% endhint %}

Once you're strong enough, save the world:

{% code title="hello.sh" %}
```bash
# Ain't no code for that yet, sorry
echo 'You got to trust me on this, I saved the world'
```
{% endcode %}
